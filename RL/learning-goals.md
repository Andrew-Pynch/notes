# Learning Goals For RL
I am quite weak in terms of having a rich understanding of many of the "up and coming" 
hotness in RL. I would like to improve this
* [X] Q Learning 
    - I feel I have a pretty good wrap on this
* [ ] Deep Q Learning from the foundations
    * [ ] Literally solve any gym environment purely using DQN?
    * [ ] Cartpole from pixels?
* [ ] Policy gradients
    * [ ] Do a little bit of self study on this. Watch the A karpathy videos
    * [ ] Implement something in code. Pong?? Just like in his blog?
* [ ] Curiosity driven learning
    * [ ] [This but in code](https://pathak22.github.io/noreward-rl/resources/icml17.pdf)
