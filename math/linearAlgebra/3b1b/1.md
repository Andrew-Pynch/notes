# What is a vector?
### 3 Perspectives
- Physics Student
    - Vectors are arrows pointing in space
    - Length + Direction
    - Different Dimensions
- Computer Science Student
    - Ordered Lists of Numbers
    # House Price
        - Square Footage
        - Price
- Mathematician
    - Generalize CS and Math Students views
    - Anything where you can perform valid vector operations
    - I.E Vector addition and multiplication by numbers

# Thinking About Vectors
## Arrow in a cordinate system with tail at center of plane
- Almost always visualize the vector rooted at the origin
- Build new concepts on top of this idea

# Coordinates of vector
- List of numbers [-2, 3] @ 2d
    - First number is how far we "walk" along the x axis
    - Second number is how far we "walk" along the y axis
- @3d ordered triplet of numbers
- [2, 1, 3], x, y, z
- Each triplet maps to exactly 1 vector

# Adding Vectors
## Tip to Tail Method
- Draw your first vector centered at the origin
- Draw your second vector with the tail centered at the tip of your first vector
- Draw a new vector from the origin to the tip of your second vector. This new vector 
will be the resulting vector from vector1 + vector2
## Vectors are directions through space
- This is kind of an extension of how we add numbers on a number line. 

# Vector Multiplication By A Constant
- Scales the vector by a constant factor
- Scalar ~= Number

# Linear Algebra revolves around addition and multiplacation of vectors and matrices
